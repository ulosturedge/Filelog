# Filelog

Filelog system made with Codeigniter3 and MYSQL.

This project focuses on a file workflow system.

Brief Summary: This application dynamically brings files into a main folder which uses tables to track the status of these(pdf) files. The charts are automatically updated as files are brought into target subfolders. Files are "checked in/out" and the charts are updated everytime the file has been modified. When page is refreshed the tables are automatically updated with the time file has been sitting in directory since last modification. All posts are sent to a log table. Color Coded tables lets user know which are new entries, which are currently being modified, and which are ready for output.

Application also has an admin panel to add/remove user and export master log to pdf or excel.
